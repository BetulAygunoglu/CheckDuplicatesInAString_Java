# Check Duplicates In A String
This project's purpose is to check and inform the user if there are any duplicate characters in a string or not.

## Introduction
Starting the first character in a string, the program compares each character with the other until it finds a duplicate character.
When a duplicate is found, it returns 'true'. 
Otherwise, it returns 'false'.

## How to Use
When you run the code it prints a message on the console:
#### "Enter a string(Type q to exit): "
It asks user to enter a string. Enter any string you want. 
Then, it performs its opeartions on the string and, returns 'true' or 'false'.
This continues until user types 'q' on the console.
When 'q' is typed it stops the run and exits the program.
